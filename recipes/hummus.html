    </p>
    <p>Prep time: 10 to 20 minutes. Total time: 30 minutes. 8 Servings.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can (15 ounces) garbanzo beans, preferably drained</li>
        <li>1 lemon freshly squeezed, more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 to 3 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tahini</li>
        <li>2 to 4 tablespoons ice water, more as needed</li>
        <li>Any of the following garnishes: 
            drizzled olive oil, sprinkle of smoked paprika, 
            chopped fresh parsley
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine the lemon juice, garlic and salt. Process until the garlic is very finely chopped, then let the mixture rest so the garlic flavor can mellow, ideally 5 to 10 minutes while you get the rest of the ingredients ready.</li>
        <li>Add the tahini to the food processor and blend until the mixture is thick and creamy, stopping to scrape down any tahini stuck to the sides and bottom of the processor as necessary.</li>
        <li>While running the food processor, drizzle in 2 tablespoons ice water. Scrape down the food processor, and blend until the mixture is ultra smooth, pale and creamy. (If your tahini was extra-thick to begin with, you might need to add 1 to 2 tablespoons more ice water.)</li>
        <li>Add the cumin, smoked paprika, and chickpeas to the food processor. While blending, drizzle in the olive oil. Blend until the mixture is super smooth, scraping down the sides of the processor as necessary, about 2 minutes. Add more ice water by the tablespoon if necessary to achieve a super creamy texture.</li>
        <li>Taste, and adjust as necessary—I almost always add another ¼ teaspoon salt for more overall flavor and another tablespoon of lemon juice for extra zing.</li>
        <li>Scrape the hummus into a serving bowl or platter, and use a spoon to create nice swooshes on top. Top with garnishes of your choice, and serve. Leftover hummus keeps well in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 1 week.</li>
    </ol>
